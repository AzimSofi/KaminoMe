# kaminome

## Local Setup Guide (英語で説明されています)
This document will guide you through setting up and running this project on your local machine. We'll be using XAMPP, an open-source cross-platform web server solution, to run the application.

### Prerequisites:
Make sure you have [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) installed.

### Setup steps:

1. Start the Apache Server: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache server by clicking on the "Start" button next to "Apache".

2. Download the Project Source Code: Head over to the [kaminome GitHub repository](https://github.com/AzimSofi/kaminome) and download the source code by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".

3. Extract the Project Files: Extract the downloaded ZIP file. This will contain the entire source code for the kaminome project.

4. Copy the Project to htdocs: Navigate to the location where you installed XAMPP (usually, it's in the C drive). Open the xampp folder and then open the htdocs folder. Paste the extracted KaminoMe project folder here.

5. Note: Ensure that the project files are directly within the kaminome-main folder and not inside another subfolder. The path should look like this: C:\xampp\htdocs\kaminome-main\.

6. Access the Project in Your Browser: Open a new browser window or tab and enter http://localhost/kaminome-main/index.php in the address bar. Press Enter to access the kaminome project locally.
